# NewsApp
Country based news app built for iOS devices using SwiftUI

For country code I made a small Flask API to get the country code and name from the latitude and longitudes and also used the Geopy library in python.
For the news I used the newsApi.com api.

The flask API is currently running in a docker container: https://raghavtinker.servatom.com
Thanks to the Servatom network!
